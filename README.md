# Text-To-Image 

Hello, I am working on a wonderful project that can generate images from text. 
I am using the diffusion model, a state-of-the-art technique that can create realistic and diverse images. 
My project is free to use, but it is still in progress and not ready for real-life use. Please be patient, 
as I am working hard to improve it. You can also access the code publicly and see how it works.
