This model aims to create stunning images people never imagined in their minds. 

I am using this dataset to train this model: [**LAION-400M**](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset/)

Note : 

- This dataset's total size is 1 TB
- But this time I use 60GB.
- GPU I am Using â€” **4x NVIDIA A100**

### My Goal ðŸŽ¯

- How I use less data & computation power produces better output.
